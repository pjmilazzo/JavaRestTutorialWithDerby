<H1>Java Restful Service Tutorial adapted from 308tube on youtube</H1>
<p>This is how to create a Java Restful Service.<br>
Please go to <a href="http://youtube.com/308tube">http://youtube.com/308tube</a> to see the original tutorials and
<a href="https://github.com/308tube/com.youtube.rest">https://github.com/308tube/com.youtube.rest</a><br>
for original source code.
</p>

<H2>Pre-Reqs</H2>
<p>Make sure Derby and Tomcat are installed and setup.  Test with DerbyWithTomcat project.  If additional details are needed, <br/>
there is a ".mht" file in the doc folder of the DerbyWithTomcat project that will get you going quickly.  If you want to review without Derby, <br/>
there is another project called JavaRestTutorial which has no db needed at all.<br /><br />
For derby database table setup with this project, there is a JavaRestfulServiceTutorial.sql file to drop and recreate the PC_PARTS table.  
This tutorial assumes that the primary key auto increments in case ported to another db.

<H2>Part #2</H2>
<p>Start creating our Java Rest Service using the Jersey Framework</p>
<p> For more information on Jersey, please go to http://jersey.java.net/<br/>
<p>Two API resources were create in part 2:<p>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/status">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/status</a><br>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/status/version">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/status/version</a><br>
<HR>

<h2>Part #3</h2>
<p>
One API resource was created in part 3: <br />
This uses derby instead of oracle<br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/status/database">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/status/database</a>
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Part #4</h2>
<p>
One API resources was created in part 4: <br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/inventory">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/inventory</a>
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Part #5</h2>
<p>
Inventory API was updated to version 3 to allow passing in brand as a query param: <br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory?brand=HP">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory?brand=HP</a><br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory?brand=IBM">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory?brand=IBM</a><br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory?brand=Dell">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory?brand=dell</a><br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory?brand=amd">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory?brand=amd</a><br />
<br />Added error response if brand param is missing:<br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory</a><br />

<br />Inventory API was updated to allow passing in brand as a path param: <br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/HP">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/HP</a><br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/IBM">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/IBM</a><br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/Dell">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/dell</a><br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/amd">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/amd</a><br />

<br />Inventory API was updated to allow passing in brand and item number as a path params: <br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/HP/123456">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/HP/123456</a><br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/HP/123459">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v3/inventory/HP/123459</a><br />

<h2>Part #6</h2>
<p>Introducing the POST method, we will be using POST to insert into the PC PARTS database table. There is going to be two examples. One using data binding (object mapping)
The other way (2) is the use JSONArrays and JSONObjects. Both ways are valid, choose which one you want to go with.
</p>
<p>
In order to demo POST, I have created a simple web form with a POST ajax request. <br />
<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/post.html">POST web form</a>
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Part #7</h2>
<p>Introducing the PUT and DELETE method.  The code is very similar to the POST method.</p>
<p>
	Click on the link for a demo of PUT, this web form will allow you to update the PC_PARTS_AVAIL number. <br />
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/put.html">PUT web form</a>
	<br /><br />
	
	The link below is a demo of DELETE, this web form will allow you to delete a row from PC PARTS table. <br />
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/delete.html">DELETE web form</a>
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Extras</h3>
<p>
	Example of parsing the header in: 
	V2_header.java, ParseHttpHeader.java <br /> 
	Demo: <a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/header">http://localhost:8080/JavaRestTutorialWithDerby/api/v2/header</a>
	<br /><br />
	
	Example of jsonp resource code: 
	V4_inventory.java <br />
	No demo of this resource
	<br /><br />
